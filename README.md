# Steger-Centerline
The program is used for detecting center line use Steger algorithm showing in 
http://ifunplay.com/docs/An_Unbiased_Detector_of_Curvilinear_Structures.pdf

eig2image and Hessian2D is copied from internet,
z_lineCenterPts function reference the eig2image and Hessian2D functions.
algorithm is the main function.,

The result is not exactly the same as the paper says, which detected many other lines.
